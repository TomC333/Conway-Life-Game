## Background 🤯

I first heard about Conway's *Game of Life* during my university studies. This game, with its simple yet profound rules, amazed me—it’s incredible what such simplicity can achieve, 
much like in real life! 🌱 For a few days, I enjoyed exploring web-based versions, such as [this one](https://playgameoflife.com/). 
Eventually, I decided to take it a step further and create my own version. 😄 

## Rules Of Game 📜

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## Setup 🌱

To be honest, I hate Java 🙄. I don't know what exactly, but Java looks like an unordered room 🤨 where everything is available, but you have to find them 💭. 
So, for the setup section, I'm just giving readers of this README the freedom to figure out how to run this project.

P.S. Or just simply download [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) from JetBrains—JetBrains is cool 😏.
