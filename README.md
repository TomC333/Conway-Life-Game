## Introduction üó®Ô∏è

The Conway's Game of Life, also known simple as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

## Rules üìú

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## Features ‚è≥

- [ ] Basic implementation of Conway's Game of Life.


Upcoming Features in the Next Update:
- [ ] Color options for cells.
- [ ] Adjustable cell size from GUI.
- [ ] Infinite grid support.
