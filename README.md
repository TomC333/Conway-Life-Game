A simple Java implementation of Conwayâ€™s *Game of Life*, inspired by its elegant rules and emergent complexity.  
Built during university as a fun experiment, this version takes a wild approach: **each cell runs in its own thread**.  
Itâ€™s not the most efficient design â€” but it was a great way to explore concurrency (and stress the CPU ðŸ˜…).
